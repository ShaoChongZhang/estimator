Verbose level, the higher, the more accurate (not guaranteed)

level 1: input size, PE count, frequency

This level is only usable when internal architecture of the kernel is known,
so it works for MM so far.
It estimates the number of each element.

level 2: LUTS, register, DSP, BRAM

This level can be used to estimate any kernel with the variables known.
The parameters are tuned for MM so accuracy on other kenrel is not guranteed.
Since element count can be estimated fairly accurately, 
this level requires accurate element count as input to out-perform level 1.

level 3: with advanced knowledge of the kernel

More complex estimation
